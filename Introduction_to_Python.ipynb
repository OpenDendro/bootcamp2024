    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful, object-oriented, open source, and widely used programming language that is one of the most commonly used in data science and increasingly across academic disciplines and the private sector.  However, if you are accustomed to other languages like MATLAB or R, or are a novice programmer, it can take awhile to get used to the Pythonic way of doing things.  This notebook seeks to provide you with a basic introduction to Python with a focus on the syntax and the type of tasks you might do when you use `dplpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted** language (like MATLAB or R), which means you don't need to compile code yourself for it to run.  This allows Python code to be relatively easy to debug, largely portable (e.g. cross-platform), easily readable, and tractable.  The primary trade off is that it will be slower than a compiled language like FORTRAN.  It is also very extensible - a large community has written and curated packages of code that allow you to do a lot with relatively little coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also is easily useable in Juypter notebooks (like you're using now).  This makes it good for both teaching and sharing your code (and results and figures) with others.  We'll talk more about how to use Juypter notebooks in the introductory part of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks and Python code in general, you can comment out lines of code so they aren't read when the road runs. This can be useful for documenting what a line of code does or for troubleshooting or debugging.  To comment our a single line or a part of a line you can use `#`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with though, Python has the capacity to function as a simple calculator.  You can do arthimatic operations in a straightforward and intuitive way:"

    "### An aside on zero-based counting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a zero-index language.  Instead of starting to count at 1 (which is intuitive), Python counts starting at zero. So in the 'my_list' list, 1 is in position 0 (the 0th position). \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is really counterintuitive and I personally still struggle with it (especially coming from MATLAB and FORTRAN which start numbering with 1).  The reason for zero indexing is largely [mathematically motivated](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html), where describing e.g. ranges of values is more naturally thought about with respect to zero, whereas index schemes that start at 1 are more typical of counting actual things.  Unfortunately, most of us do tend to think of numbers as primarily for counting ('I have 2 eggs', 'Take the 3rd right turn').  See a broader discussion of this and links here: https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2017/03/12/why-1-based-indexing-is-ok/\n",
    "\n",
    "The only intuitive way of thinking about this I can offer you at this point is this:  Imagine Python indexing as describing the solution to the following description: 'Once I am in a starting position, how far do I have to go to get to the result I'm looking for?'.  So in the example below, if you start in the first position of the `fruits` list (orange), you need to move 3 positions to get to banana (or 'Starting at orange, I need to move three positions, 1st to apple, 2nd to pear, and 3rd to banana').  You could also think of how we talk about birthdays - e.g. your 1st birthday is actually the anniversary of your birth day (which is your 0th birthday).\n"

    "Observe a few things about the commands above.  First, the object-oriented focus of Python allows us to string together several operations or methods in a row, instead of doing these on several lines.  Second, take a look at the module `.arange`.  This module takes an (optional) starting number, a stopping number, and an optional step size and generates a set of evenly spaced values separated by a given step between a certain interval.  As we learned in the Introductory notebook, an odd behavior of `.arange` is that the interval does not include the stop value (!) if it is an integer (you can see this perhaps as 'starting with 0, give me 15 numbers', but it is still counter-intuitive to me).  See more about `.arange` here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html.\n",
